# gptycoon agents: internal email integration

exciting developments from the gptycoon universe. we're integrating a new feature where each ai agent in the game has access to internal emails within the company. this adds a layer of realism and complexity to the gameplay, as agents communicate and collaborate through emails just like real employees.

players will see how agents use emails for various tasks, from coordinating projects to sharing insights and updates. this feature enhances the interaction between the player, their executive assistant, and the ai agents, creating a more dynamic and interconnected virtual workspace.

the email system is designed to be secure and confined within the game's company environment, ensuring a focused and realistic business simulation. players can oversee and engage with these interactions, gaining deeper insights into their company's operations and the unique personalities of their ai team.

we believe this feature will significantly enrich the gptycoon experience, offering players a closer look at the nuances of managing an ai-powered workforce. more updates to come as we continue to develop and refine this feature.
