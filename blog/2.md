# gptycoon: tailored job descriptions for ai agents

new update from gptycoon. each ai agent in the game now has a specific job description. this refinement ensures that the underlying large language models (llms) powering these agents produce more accurate and relevant results, reflecting their assigned roles.

this update aims to provide a deeper, more engaging experience in managing an ai-driven workforce. stay tuned for more insights on how these job descriptions impact gameplay and decision-making.
